# Tie::iCal #

Tie::iCal makes working with RFC 2445 iCalendar files as easy as dealing with hashes in Perl.

It can greatly simplify merging, parsing and manipulating several iCalendar files all at once.

  * Simple structure - Intuitive mapping between iCalendar components, names, parameters and properties and Perl data structure.
  * Complete Support - Near complete RFC 2445 support by concentrating mostly on the iCalendar file format.
  * Pure Perl - Available on all platforms where a Perl port exists.

# Win32::GUI::XMLBuilder #

Win32::GUI::XMLBuilder or WGX is a way to build simple Win32 GUI interfaces in Perl while keeping the visual design separate from the inner workings of the code.

WGX makes it easy to add a Win32 user interface to whatever script or module youâ€™re writing.

  * XML Based GUI Creation - Keeping your GUI structure in XML format is easier to grasp than needing to maintain a linear list of commands to construct each element.
  * Dynamic Auto-resizing - Writing simple Win32::GUI applications can be annoying having to manually write widget and child resizing routines, WGX deals with this automatically but keeping track of your widgets and fitting them to their parents. One can still override the defaults if required.
  * Embeded Perl Events - Win32::GUI NEM events allow you to specify a widget and attach a callback or event routine at the same time.
  * Extended Widget Set - WGX provides some additional widgets that augment Win32::GUI such as WGXSplitter, WGXPanel and WGXMenu.
